        <p>Profile: I am an inqusitive person who enjoys learning as much as I can about topics and disciplines that catch my interest. I have some experience in programming from my time in school and knowledge of computer related technologies from my time working in electronics. I am a rather jovial person to those around me, but I can focus on the task at hand and can get the job done when I need to work and learn. I do what I can to come up with creative solutions to my problems and look to grow as a person through this course.</p>
